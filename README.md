# What

My project where I made LINQ methods.

# How

I tried to provide quality code in this project:

1. Latest C# codestyle.
2. Documentation.
3. Thorough tests.
4. Big O time and space complexity estimates.

# Why

1. Because It is very effective way of learning new useful things in C#!
2. It was interesting experience doing new algorithms and comparing with official documentation. 
3. It was fun.
