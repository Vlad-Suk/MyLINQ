# What
- My project where I made LINQ methods.
- To my LINQ methods I made tests and documentation.
# How 
- You can see alternative and simplify variants of implementation LINQ expressions.
- In documentation to each method you can check O(n) in memory and O(n) in time. 
# Why
- Because It is very effective way of learning new useful things in C#.
- It was interesting experience doing new algorithms and comparing with official documentation.
